# Pros and Cons of TTD:
# Personally, I see a lot of pros in TDD. It is a pattern I also developed during my PEY as a ruby developer, where
# TDD with rspec is mandatory on the team. TDD forces me to code in a more modularized manner with good architecture as
# priority, which is something that is usually prefered in object oriented programming. I find this type of patter makes the 
# codes easier to understand and also easier for collaboration.
#
# In terms of the cons, I usually find TTD annoying when I need to make small changes but forgot that these are tied to a 
# unit test, making the time for refactoring longer. TDD is also not as easy to get used to especailly at the start of my PEY.
# I would still say maintenance and the extra work needed during refactorying is the biggest cons I have experienced.
